The Day 01 practicals focus on strengthening core Java skills essential for Spring Boot, covering basic syntax, OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction), and data structures like arrays. Exercises include reversing a sequence, building a library system, and modeling a retail store. These tasks prepare you for advanced Spring Boot topics like dependency injection and REST APIs by emphasizing clean, modular, and reusable code.
